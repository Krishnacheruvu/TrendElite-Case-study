Predictive Pricing Optimization Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning to implement a dynamic pricing model, optimizing revenue generation for retail stores. The model utilizes XGBoost, a robust ensemble learning algorithm, to predict optimal product prices based on historical sales data. The approach automates price adjustments, saving time and effort, and generates an additional $300 in revenue compared to static pricing methods. As the model evolves with new data, it is expected to enhance its performance further and be scalable across multiple stores.
